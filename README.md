# Ireland_REI
Code used to create a relative exposure index for the coastline of Ireland. Workflow is limited to one section of coastline due to file size constraints. 
area_5 (inner Galway Bay) is the smallest area and therefore the area for testing code.

📄 Code
---------

**1-chunk_processing_fetch.R** - Generates basic fetch distances in 32 directions.

**2-weighting_windir.R** - Weights the fetch distances by wind direction.

**3-relative_exposure_index.R** - Creates the REI with wind-weighted fetch and mean wind speed.

**4-focal_smoothing.R** - Applies a guassian smoothing function to the REI, creating the final dataset.

**5-validation.R** - Correlation analysis of the REI and SWAN model.

**6-extract_REI.R** - Extracts REI values from a csv file containing GPS coordinates.


📁 Files
