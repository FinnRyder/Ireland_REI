# Ireland_REI
Code used to create a relative exposure index for the coastline of Ireland. Workflow is limited to one section of coastline due to file size constraints. 

'chunk_processing_fetch.R' is used to generate fetch lengths.
'weighting_windir.R' is used for weighting the fetch lenghts by wind direction.


area_5 (inner Galway Bay) is the smallest area and is for testing code
